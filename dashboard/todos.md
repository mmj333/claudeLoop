## claude-loop9

- [ ] 🟡 Also, I feel like we should make use of these and show the latest ones per loop in the dashboard: /home/michael/.claude/todos
  - [ ] 🟡 shift + tab keyboard shortcut for claude dashboard
- [ ] 🟡 Also, unless we combine todo utilities (mine and default-claude's) I think we need a way to auto send him ToDo's from this list and give him (or remind him of) tools to add things to the list, and update this list.
- [ ] 🟡 Would be cool to have a way to detect when claude was asking you a question on the screen and... and more quickly send tmux an "enter" key. And/or if we could have another AI analyze the message and decide whether or not to hit enter ;)
- [~] 🟡 The countdown next to "Next message in:" doesn't count down smoothly. We could probably fix this without adding much inefficiency I'd assume. :) -

## claude-loop3

- [ ] 🟡 make a utility for claude to query, that will fetching next skill for him to work on.
  - [ ] 🔴 Get INFINI working for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy exercises. We need to be able to process our emotions and false beliefs. :)

## General

- [ ] 🟡 Concurrent test 1756098376263
- [~] 🟡 need to be able to re-sort this list
- [~] 🟡 (Default project folders could = 1 per claude loop session, with the same name) and the relevant one could be shown on the top of the to-do list when that session is active. 
- [~] 🟡 It would be cool to have ToDo lists organized into folders by project. Also being able to support sub-tasks 
  - [x] 🟡 Also, I'd like claude's checkbox and my checkbox to be on the let side of this to-do list. Instead of over on the right side by the delete button. It just feels better for some reason to have checkboxes on the left. That's how I've been doing it my whole life.
